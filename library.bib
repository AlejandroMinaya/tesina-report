@article{Rosenblat2015,
abstract = {Employers often struggle to assess qualified applicants, particularly in contexts where they receive hundreds of applications for job openings. In an effort to increase efficiency and improve the process, many have begun employing new tools to sift through these applications, looking for signals that a candidate is “the best fit.” Some companies use tools that offer algorithmic assessments of workforce data to identify the variables that lead to stronger employee performance, or to high employee attrition rates, while others turn to third party ranking services to identify the top applicants in a labor pool. Still others eschew automated systems, but rely heavily on publicly available data to assess candidates beyond their applications. For example, some HR managers turn to LinkedIn to determine if a candidate knows other employees or to identify additional information about them or their networks. Although most companies do not intentionally engage in discriminatory hiring practices (particularly on the basis of protected classes), their reliance on automated systems, algorithms, and existing networks systematically benefits some at the expense of others, often without employers even recognizing the biases of such mechanisms. The intersection of hiring practices and the Big Data phenomenon has not produced inherently new challenges. While this paper addresses issues of privacy, fairness, transparency, accuracy, and inequality under the rubric of discrimination, it does not pivot solely around the legal definitions of discrimination under current federal anti-discrimination law. Rather, it describes a number of areas where issues of inherent bias intersect with, or come into conflict with, socio-cultural notions of fairness. },

abstract = {In this paper, contemporary Natural Language Processing techniques have been leveraged to demonstrate the capability of data-driven HR towards significant improvement in the quality and speed of the whole recruiting process. Firstly, by using NLP, a resume parser has been implemented to analyze the most crucial recruitment parameters. Thereafter, ability to display a pie chart for a candidate has been employed in the algorithmic structure of the parser to prepare a powerful tool for the resume matching based on job criteria. To determine the efficacy and accuracy of the proposed resume ranker, an enhanced rival modern optimizer, i.e., firefly ranking algorithm is applied to accelerate the speed of ranking algorithm. An overall accuracy of 94.19{\%} has been achieved by the proposed approach. The results indicate that the resume parser has been incorporated with robust techniques and hence concedes to the accuracy of the results.},

abstract = {Finding suitable candidates for an open role could be a daunting task, especially when there are many applicants. It can impede team progress for getting the right person on the right time. An automated way of "Resume Classification and Matching" could really ease the tedious process of fair screening and shortlisting, it would certainly expedite the candidate selection and decisionmaking process. This system could work with a large number of resumes for first classifying the right categories using different classifier, once classification has been done then as per the job description, top candidates could be ranked using Content-based Recommendation, using cosine similarity and by using k-NN to identify the CVs that are nearest to the provided job description.},

abstract = {We present conditional random fields, a framework for building probabilistic models to segment and label sequence data. Conditional random fields offer several advantages over hidden Markov models and stochastic grammars for such tasks, including the ability to relax strong independence assumptions made in those models. Conditional random fields also avoid a fundamental limitation of maximum entropy Markov models (MEMMs) and other discriminative Markov models based on directed graphical models, which can be biased towards states with few successor states. We present iterative parameter estimation algorithms for conditional random fields and compare the performance of the resulting models to HMMs and MEMMs on synthetic and natural-language data.},

abstract = {Nowadays the number of people searching work is increasing and the number of university graduates is also getting larger. Companies searching for a perfect job candidate for a person working in the informatics domain may be lost between different resumes with different formats and big quantity. Selecting the best curriculum vitae (CV) is a considered a big step to help any company decide whether a job seeker is suitable or not. The criteria that should be taken into consideration is divided between a block of private information and another block of professional data. The blocks are based on age, education, participating in real projects, availability of published papers or research activities, possessing modern programming languages and technologies and so on. Selecting the perfect candidate needs an estimation based on a choice function similar to the utility function which weighs the different criteria and helps in evaluating them numerically. But since we may be dealing with some fuzzy or uncertain information we proposed the use of modified Boyer Moore algorithm and RELIEF method to reach the target.},

@article{Fritts2021,
abstract = {According to a recent survey by the HR Research Institute, as the presence of artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly common in the workplace, HR professionals are worried that the use of recruitment algorithms will lead to a “dehumanization” of the hiring process. Our main goals in this paper are threefold: (i) to bring attention to this neglected issue, (ii) to clarify what exactly this concern about dehumanization might amount to, and (iii) to sketch an argument for why dehumanizing the hiring process is ethically suspect. After distinguishing the use of the term “dehumanization” in this context (i.e. removing the human presence) from its more common meaning in the interdisciplinary field of dehumanization studies (i.e. conceiving of other humans as subhuman), we argue that the use of hiring algorithms may negatively impact the employee-employer relationship. We argue that there are good independent reasons to accept a substantive employee-employer relationship, as well as an applicant-employer relationship, both of which are consistent with a stakeholder theory of corporate obligations. We further argue that dehumanizing the hiring process may negatively impact these relationships because of the difference between the values of human recruiters and the values embedded in recruitment algorithms. Drawing on Nguyen's (in: Lackey, Applied Epistemology, Oxford University Press, 2021) critique of how Twitter “gamifies communication”, we argue that replacing human recruiters with algorithms imports artificial values into the hiring process. We close by briefly considering some ways to potentially mitigate the problems posed by recruitment algorithms, along with the possibility that some difficult trade-offs will need to be made.},

abstract = {Resume screening is the first hurdle applicants typically face when they apply for a job. Despite the many empirical studies showing bias at the resume-screening stage, fairness at this funnelling stage has not been reviewed systematically. In this paper, a three-stage model of biased resume screening is presented. We first discuss relevant theoretical perspectives (e.g., job market signalling and impression formation theories) to explain why resume screening is vulnerable to biased decision-making and ethnic discrimination in particular. On the basis of the best available evidence, we consider contingencies of ethnic discrimination in the applicant, the decision-maker, and the broader context (e.g., organisation), as well as the effectiveness of interventions that might counter ethnic bias in resume screening. The paper ends with a critical agenda for further research and practice.},

One such industry where Artificial Intelligence (AI) importance is growing is the recruiting industry. This paper aims to propose a new and a better method to match the most suitable talent to jobs, which has been incorporated using two methods – suggesting top resumes to a job opening from a talent pool to a recruiter, recommending top jobs which match to a candidate based on the candidate's resume. Natural Language Processing techniques have been used in implementing this approach – Named Entity Recognition (NER), Word embedding model, and Cosine similarity using which a resume and job will be matched. The NER model is used to extract useful entities from documents, which is enhanced by the word2vec model by making the system more generic and the similarity is calculated using the cosine similarity algorithm.},
